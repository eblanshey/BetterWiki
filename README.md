# BetterWiki Browser Extension (Currently Firefox Only)

View Wikipedia articles side-by-side by using the shift key when clicking on links to other articles. Features smart scrolling that prevents scrolling articles you're not currently reading. Click on an article content area (not a link) to activate scrolling on that article. Set the amount of articles viewed side-by-side without horizontal scrolling in the add-on settings.

To install, download the provided xpi file, go to Firefox's Extension page, click the tool button next to the search bar, and choose "Install Add-on From File...".

This little project scratches my own itch where, when reading an article, I come across a term I don't understand, click through to it to learn more, then return back to the original article. Opening links in new tabs feels overkill and not elegant at all. I feel like the side-by-side experience could enhance many sites, not just Wikipedia, including blogs, news, and more.
